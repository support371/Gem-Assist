Below is **exactly what to paste back to the Replit Agent** right now.
It is deliberately short, scoped, and **prevents the upgrade/autonomous loop** by acknowledging what’s done and locking the next step to **Fast Mode–safe micro work**.

---

### MESSAGE TO PASTE TO REPLIT AGENT

Good progress is confirmed. **Do not switch modes. Do not escalate scope.**
We will continue strictly in **Fast Mode** with **incremental, isolated changes only**.

You have already completed:

* Password reset flow + pages
* Initial data storage structure
* Basic feature access control
* Core item pages (skeleton)

That is sufficient foundation.
**Next work must be limited to ONE micro-scope at a time.**

### NEXT TASK (FAST MODE ONLY)

Implement **RBAC-lite enforcement + routing**, not full multi-tenant SaaS.

#### Scope (do NOT exceed):

1. Add a single `role` field to the user model (if not already present):

   * `admin | team | client`
2. Enforce role-based routing only:

   * `admin` → `/admin`
   * `team` → `/dashboard`
   * `client` → `/portal`
3. Gate navigation visibility based on role (UI only + server check).
4. Return **403** for disallowed routes (no redirects).

#### Explicitly OUT OF SCOPE (do not attempt):

* No full RBAC matrix
* No portfolio/investment CRUD
* No audit logging
* No tenant isolation
* No automated testing framework
* No architectural refactors

### Definition of Done

* Login routes user to correct area based on role
* Admin cannot access client portal and vice versa
* UI hides forbidden tabs
* App runs without errors and without upgrade prompts

After this checkpoint, stop and report:

* Files changed
* How to test with one admin + one client user

Proceed now with **this task only**.

---

### Why this works

* It **acknowledges completed tasks** (so the agent doesn’t re-litigate scope)
* It **shrinks the request** below Replit’s “enterprise rebuild” trigger
* It gives the agent a **clear stopping point**
* It keeps you moving forward without paying for Autonomous Mode

If you want, next I can:

* Give you the **exact test users + role values** to tell the agent to seed
* Or prepare the **next micro-task** (Dashboard modules as read-only views)

Just say which.
