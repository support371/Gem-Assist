Here is the **exact instruction** to paste to the **Replit agent in charge of your website build**. It is scoped, enterprise-focused, and Fast Mode-compatible.

---

## REPLIT AGENT — ENTERPRISE UPGRADE MANDATE (SSA WEBSITE)

You are the Replit agent responsible for upgrading my existing SSA website into a **higher-quality, enterprise-grade SaaS platform**.
Do **not** create a new repository or a parallel build. Modify the current project in-place. Use **Fast Mode** only. Do not ask for Autonomous Mode or upgrades.

### Primary Outcome

Deliver an enterprise-grade SaaS with full support for:

* Teams
* Users
* RBAC (role-based access control)
* Grants
* Dashboard + Portfolio
* Investments + Portfolio Management
* Admin access
* Team access
* Newsletter + announcements
* Client Portal (external users)
* Audit logging + diagnostics (enterprise credibility)

---

# PHASE 1 — FOUNDATION (Non-Negotiable)

## 1) Recon & Stack Confirmation

Run and report:

* `ls -la`
* detect stack (frontend, backend, DB)
* identify auth flow and dashboard entry route
* list top 8 files to be edited first

**Acceptance:** You can clearly identify where auth, routing, and data storage live.

## 2) Enterprise Navigation (High Quality UX)

Implement consistent navigation structure (no redesign required):

* Dashboard
* Portfolio
* Investments
* Grants
* Evidence/Docs
* Reports
* Newsletter
* Client Portal (role-gated)
* Admin (role-gated)

**Acceptance:** App looks organized and enterprise-ready immediately; no blank pages.

## 3) RBAC Core (Must Ship Early)

Implement roles:

* Super Admin
* Admin
* Team Member
* Client/Investor
* Partner/Trustee
* Subscriber

Rules:

* Enforce role checks on both frontend and backend
* Block URL access if role lacks permissions

**Acceptance:** No user can reach Admin routes or other tenant data by guessing URLs.

---

# PHASE 2 — MULTI-TENANT + TEAMS

## 4) Org/Tenant + Teams Model

Implement:

* Organization (tenant)
* Teams within org
* User-team assignment
* Team-scoped data visibility

Add Admin screens:

* Admin > Organizations
* Admin > Teams
* Admin > Users + Role assignment

**Acceptance:** Team A cannot see Team B’s data unless explicitly allowed.

---

# PHASE 3 — DASHBOARD FRAMEWORK (CONFIGURABLE MODULES)

## 5) Modular Dashboard System

Create configurable modules:

* Overview
* Briefing/Updates
* Financials
* Portfolio
* Investments
* Grants
* Evidence/Docs
* Source Material
* Activity/Audit Logs

Requirements:

* Modules can be enabled/disabled per org (Admin control)
* No blank dashboard: show setup wizard or demo seed content if empty
* Load modules independently (code splitting/lazy loading)

**Acceptance:** Every org can configure its dashboard; content persists.

---

# PHASE 4 — BUSINESS FEATURES (ENTERPRISE CORE)

## 6) Portfolio

CRUD + list + pagination:

* assets, valuations, notes, attachments

## 7) Investments

CRUD + list + status tracking:

* investment entries, outcomes/returns, reporting exports

## 8) Grants

Lifecycle:

* created → reviewed → approved → allocated → closed
  Include:
* allocations, beneficiaries, compliance notes, attachments

**Acceptance:** Portfolio/Investments/Grants are usable, stable, and role/team scoped.

---

# PHASE 5 — EXTERNAL EXPERIENCE

## 9) Client Portal (External Users)

Create `/portal/*` routes with strict scoping:

* portfolio summary
* investment snapshot
* downloadable reports/documents
* announcements
* limited contact/messaging

**Acceptance:** External users see only their permitted data; no internal ops exposure.

---

# PHASE 6 — COMMUNICATIONS

## 10) Newsletter + Announcements

Implement:

* public newsletter subscribe
* admin campaign editor (internal)
* announcements pushed into dashboard + client portal
* role-based visibility

**Acceptance:** Admin can publish updates; subscribers have limited access only.

---

# PHASE 7 — ENTERPRISE CREDIBILITY (OBSERVABILITY + SECURITY)

## 11) Health, Diagnostics, Graded Performance

Implement:

* `/health` and `/ready`
* Admin > Diagnostics page showing:

  * uptime, version, db status, error rate
  * performance grade (A/B/C based on p95 latency + error rate)

Add Admin-only **Safe Mode**:

* disables heavy modules if degraded while keeping core nav/auth stable

## 12) Audit Logging (Must Have)

Log sensitive actions:

* role changes, team changes
* grant approvals
* investment updates
* document access
  Capture:
* actor, action, timestamp, target, metadata

**Acceptance:** Audit logs exist and are viewable by Admin.

---

# DELIVERY RULES

* Work in small commits and verify after each phase:

  * login still works
  * dashboard loads
  * role gating works
  * no blank states
* Prefer configuration and modularization over big rewrites.
* If backend access is constrained, implement frontend-first persistence (localStorage/org scoped), but design provider layer so it can switch to backend endpoints later without rewriting UI.

---

# DEFINITION OF DONE

1. Admin can create orgs/teams/users and assign roles
2. Team/tenant scoping prevents leakage
3. Dashboard modules configurable per org
4. Portfolio/Investments/Grants fully functional
5. Client portal operational for external roles
6. Newsletter + announcements working
7. Health + diagnostics + safe mode present
8. Audit logs capture sensitive actions
9. Enterprise-grade navigation and UX consistency achieved
